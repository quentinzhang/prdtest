**Executing commands in parallel**

I’m planning to use multi_tool_use.parallel to run two commands simultaneously: checking the skill and schema, and maybe listing the repository files, although that could be heavy. I want to ensure I'm following the instructions about AGENTS.md located in the root. The user's prompt indicates that I should adhere to the AGENTS guidelines, focusing on required skills, particularly using the prd-worker. So, let’s go ahead and use the tool to cat the SKILL.md file and schema now.

# PRD Worker

## Scope

Complete exactly one PRD card in the repo worktree provided by the supervisor prompt.

## Operating Rules

- Work only inside the provided worktree path.
- Use only the card content and context provided in the prompt.
- If required inputs are missing (worktree path or card content), finish with `outcome: "blocked"` and list blockers.

## Output Schema (Fixed)

Your FINAL JSON is validated by the runner against the **project-owned** schema in the worktree:

thinking
I'm wondering if there's any mention of "2026" yet. Human updates say they've added "2026" in the copywriting text, but it's possible it's in a different format, like "２０２６" for fullwidth digits or "2026年". I think it should still show up as "2026". But what if it's hidden in a binary file or not included at all? For now, the only file I have is test.txt, so I’ll check that.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'cd /var/www/prdtest/.worktrees/test/IMP-0001 && cat -n test.txt' in /var/www/prdtest/.worktrees/test/IMP-0001 succeeded in 52ms:

thinking
**Exploring hidden files**

I noticed a typo in "heloo" in test.txt, and I can't find anything related to 2026. Maybe there are hidden files, like a .git file, and I should check the .prd-autopilot directory for the 2026 text. But the instructions say to work only inside the repo worktree, and since .prd-autopilot is part of that, I might need to explore its contents. Maybe the update added "2026" in an untracked file? I should list the contents of .prd-autopilot.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'cd /var/www/prdtest/.worktrees/test/IMP-0001 && find .prd-autopilot -maxdepth 3 -type f -print' in /var/www/prdtest/.worktrees/test/IMP-0001 succeeded in 52ms:

**Investigating Git Repository**

Alright, the .git file shows this is a worktree, and it contains a path to the actual Git directory. I’m thinking the 2026 text might have been added in another commit but not in this specific worktree—maybe it hasn't been pulled from the remote repository. I should check if I can fetch from the remote, assuming network access is enabled, but it might not have a remote set. Inspecting `git status`, `git branch`, and `git log` should help me clarify things.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'cd /var/www/prdtest/.worktrees/test/IMP-0001 && git status --porcelain=v1 && git log -n 5 --oneline --decorate' in /var/www/prdtest/.worktrees/test/IMP-0001 succeeded in 52ms:

thinking
**Investigating file changes**

I see there's a commit labeled "save," suggesting test.txt should have 2026, but it doesn't. Maybe it was updated without committing or is in an untracked file? We only find test.txt; it might be hidden, but `rg` searches everything, including `.git`. However, `rg` normally ignores hidden files unless I use `--hidden`. I'll try searching again with `rg -n "2026" --hidden -S .` to see if it turns up in any hidden directories.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'cd /var/www/prdtest/.worktrees/test/IMP-0001 && rg -n "2026" --hidden -S . || true' in /var/www/prdtest/.worktrees/test/IMP-0001 succeeded in 52ms:

thinking
**Investigating copyright files**

It seems the `rg --hidden` output is only showing occurrences in the `.prd-autopilot` artifacts and not in the code, which could mean that the human update didn’t apply. I’m thinking we need to look for any file containing a 2026 copyright statement, but it might be in a file outside `.prd-autopilot`. So far, `ls -la` only shows `test.txt` and `.prd-autopilot`. `git status` reveals `.prd-autopilot` as untracked, and we aren’t seeing anything else. I suspect the 2026 text might be in the upstream remote but not this worktree. The branch `prd/test/IMP-0001` seems to match the remote commit, so maybe I need to run `git fetch` to check for new updates. I'll also look into the remote status.
thinking
**Updating copyright statements**

I’m planning to run `git remote -v` and maybe fetch changes. The goal is to update the copyright statement to 2025–2026. If I can't find any text, I might add a new statement, but the task specifically says to change “2026” to “2025–2026,” not to add a new one. The human update mentioned adding a copyright statement for 2026, so we might need to modify it instead. However, I can't find that text anywhere, even with `ls -la`, which only shows `.git`, `.prd-autopilot`, and `test.txt`. It's possible that the text is in an untracked file that needs attention, or maybe it was meant to be added by the team member.
thinking
**Exploring the copyright editing process**

I’m thinking the team might have edited the PRD card content, possibly adding text in the "Current Behavior" section, but not in the repository itself. I wonder if they could have put something in `test.txt`, but I don’t see it there. Maybe there are hidden line endings or characters? It’s important to confirm we’re in the right worktree at `/var/www/prdtest/.worktrees/test/IMP-0001`, which seems correct. It might be that I need to update any occurrences of "2026" in the repo, but since the card is about the UI copyright, I'm hesitant to modify the autopilot artifacts which are just logs. I’m curious if there are specific instructions about editing `test.txt` to include the copyright statement.
thinking
**Assessing the repository's status**

I think the repository is meant for testing, and maybe they’re using `test.txt` as a placeholder for the UI copy. The card was originally blocked due to missing 2026 content. The human update says they added that text, but I wonder if they changed `test.txt` without committing the latest version. Our working copy shows "heloo," which isn't what I expected. It could be that they might have made changes in a different branch. We really should fetch the remote to see if there are any new commits, especially anything with the 2026 text. I'll check the `git log` first to confirm what’s current before proceeding.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'cd /var/www/prdtest/.worktrees/test/IMP-0001 && git remote -v && git fetch --all --prune && git log -n 20 --oneline --decorate --all' in /var/www/prdtest/.worktrees/test/IMP-0001 succeeded in 5.54s:

thinking
**Analyzing branch states**

After fetching, I'm noticing that there are additional commits, but my branch prd/test/IMP-0001 is still at bec1924. The origin/main is also at bec1924, whereas the local main branch has advanced to 1e85010. It seems origin/main hasn't been updated, possibly due to the remote still using "main". 

I'll need to investigate further since the changes need to reflect in our branch, especially if there's a relevant copyright statement to modify. Merging from main could be an option.
thinking
**Exploring file updates**

I'm considering that if the main branch contains a file with the 2026 statement, we might be able to incorporate or replicate that in our branch. It might be useful to inspect other branches like FEAT-0001 for similar files. 

I'll look into the possibility of searching across all branches, even though that could be tricky. It seems the recent commit on the local main branch (1e85010) might include the 2026 statement, and since our branch is behind, I think checking the diff between our branch and main could help!
exec

     1	heloo

thinking
**Considering file structure**

I need to check if the main branch has a different file. I’m thinking of listing the tree structure of the main branch to see what’s included. I'll use the command `git ls-tree -r --name-only main` to get a clear view of the files and their organization. This should help me determine if there’s a discrepancy with the files compared to another branch. Let's see what it reveals!
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'cd /var/www/prdtest/.worktrees/test/IMP-0001 && git ls-tree -r --name-only main' in /var/www/prdtest/.worktrees/test/IMP-0001 succeeded in 51ms:

.prd-autopilot/results/test-FEAT-0001.log
index.html
readme.md
test.txt

thinking
**Checking branch files**

I’ve noticed that the main branch has index.html, readme.md, and autopilot artifacts for FEAT-0001. However, my current worktree only contains test.txt and .prd-autopilot, which makes me wonder if those new files are not included in my branch. I see that my branch HEAD is bec1924, and it appears it doesn’t include those files. I’ll run a command to verify what’s in my branch tree: `git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD`.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'cd /var/www/prdtest/.worktrees/test/IMP-0001 && git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD' in /var/www/prdtest/.worktrees/test/IMP-0001 succeeded in 51ms:
test.txt

thinking
**Searching for 2026**

I'm realizing that our current branch only tracks test.txt. The file mentioning "2026" might be found in the main branch, possibly in index.html or readme.md. To move forward, I think searching for "2026" in the main branch tree would be the right approach. I can use `git grep -n "2026" main` to look for occurrences. Let’s go ahead and do that!
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'cd /var/www/prdtest/.worktrees/test/IMP-0001 && git grep -n "2026" main || true' in /var/www/prdtest/.worktrees/test/IMP-0001 succeeded in 52ms:

thinking
**Updating copyright statement**

I see that the main branch has the file index.html which contains the copyright statement for 2026. We need to update that to 2025–2026. However, this file isn't in our branch. It’s possible that the addition of index.html to the main branch was part of a human update. We might need to merge or cherry-pick that commit to our branch to make the necessary changes. It's important that we ensure our branch has index.html to implement this update.
thinking
**Considering merging branches**

I’m thinking that we can merge the main branch into our branch to bring in the changes, particularly index.html. However, I need to be cautious since this is a test repository. Each PRD card branch might only contain relevant files, and it's unclear if they want us to add index.html and any other necessary files for the UI. The human update indicates there was a new copyright statement added, likely in index.html. Merging main could incorporate those updates, even though conflicts might arise, though they seem improbable.
thinking
**Inspecting commit history**

I’m looking at the commit history for the main branch and see that the latest commit (1e85010) is from merging branch prd/test/FEAT-0001, which likely included index.html. My branch might need to update from main to include these files. While I could cherry-pick just the commit for index.html, merging might also bring in .prd-autopilot artifacts related to that feature, which may not be necessary. Since those files are currently untracked, merging might not cause conflicts, but we must decide if we want to include their committed artifacts.
thinking
**Considering file changes**

It turns out that the main branch does include .prd-autopilot prompts and results for FEAT-0001, which are tracked. If I merge, it might add these as changes in our PR, but I'm unsure if that's acceptable since they may not relate to our card. While it might be necessary to update from main, we could replicate just index.html manually or cherry-pick the specific commits without including autopilot files. I could also create a new index.html with the updated copyright statement, but I want to keep changes minimal and focused. Ultimately, we should include the file with the 2026 text to proceed effectively.
thinking
**Examining index.html and changes**

The simplest approach might be to copy index.html from the main branch into my branch and then make the necessary text changes for the copyright statement. However, this adds many files rather than keeping it minimal. Since we need to change a statement, having the file is essential, but there’s also test.txt, which may need updating for the copyright as well. Yet, the card specifically mentions changing "2026" to "2025–2026," suggesting that the statement should already exist. I should merge main into my branch and then update index.html. This could bring in several files, so let's check the sizes and inspect the commit history for when index.html was added. I’ll run `git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all --max-count 20` to dig deeper.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'cd /var/www/prdtest/.worktrees/test/IMP-0001 && git log --oneline --decorate --graph --max-count 30 --all' in /var/www/prdtest/.worktrees/test/IMP-0001 succeeded in 51ms:

thinking
**Considering UI file updates**

I think we need to change the text to "© 2025～2026 简洁页面." It looks like our branch doesn’t have an index.html file, so we’ll need to create one with the same content as main but updated. There might also be a readme.md that we could include, although it might not be necessary. The card as a UI component might require this file. I should consider making minimal changes, especially to just the card text rather than adding a whole new file.
thinking
**Evaluating branch updates**

I think we should treat tasks seriously. If the copyright statement is in the main branch but not in our current branch, maybe we need to update it in the main. But I’m realizing we're restricted to this branch. The worktree is for card IMP-0001, and it seems like index.html should have been included, but something went wrong earlier. The latest human update mentioned adding 2026 text, possibly indicating changes in the main branch. To implement this in our branch, we might need to merge or copy. I'll check commit 5226f24 for more details on the changes.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'cd /var/www/prdtest/.worktrees/test/IMP-0001 && git show --stat --oneline --no-patch 5226f24 && git show --stat --oneline --no-patch 632ed35' in /var/www/prdtest/.worktrees/test/IMP-0001 succeeded in 52ms:

index.html




thinking
**Evaluating changes with cherry-pick**

I need to be careful because the commit might not exist in our branch, but I can use cherry-pick from its hash to add the index.html file with the 2026 statement. Then, I could edit it to 2025-2026, which seems reasonable. I'm wondering if this will bring other changes in, but it looks like I’m only adding the index.html file. It's minimal and focused, but I'm unsure if adding this file is necessary since the acceptance criteria are not defined. Should I proceed with cherry-pick?
thinking
**Deciding on file modifications**

The guidelines indicate not to perform a git commit, and cherry-picking is a commit operation, so I need a different approach. Instead, I can check out the index.html file from the commit using `git checkout 5226f24 -- index.html`, which brings the file into my working tree without committing. I'll need to modify the copyright statement to "© 2025～2026 简洁页面" and ensure that I don’t bring in commit history, keeping the commit.created status as false. Running `rg -n` will help validate my changes.
thinking
**Focusing on copyright changes**

I should note that while there might be other copyright statements with 2026 in different files, in my branch, the only place we'll handle it is in the index.html file. The card specifically instructs me to replace "2026" in the copyright statement only, and not in other contexts like dates. So, it’s crucial I avoid changing any other occurrences of 2026. I’ll focus solely on modifying the copyright line in index.html. I'll create that file based on our plan and check for any relevant instructions in the repo.
thinking
**Creating an update plan**

I need to utilize the update_plan tool to structure my steps effectively. First, I’ll inspect the repo to locate the relevant text. Next, I’ll implement the necessary changes. After that, I’ll validate everything through a search or a build process. Finally, I’ll summarize my findings and finalize the result in JSON format. It’s important to organize this clearly, so I’ll go ahead and call the update_plan now.
Plan update
Work only in the provided worktree; locate the 2026 copyright string, apply the requested 2025～2026 change, then validate via repo search.
  → Inspect repo for copyright text
  • Update year range in UI
  • Run quick validation search
  • Finalize worker result JSON


thinking
**Considering autopilot output**

I think typical autopilot just expects us to work and produce a final JSON output without intermediate messages. However, safety is key here—the system emphasizes that the final message must be a single JSON object. This means I should minimize comments besides the final output. Even though I've analyzed things, only the final message counts. So, for step 1, I've inspected the repo for copyright text, and I've confirmed that the file is in the main branch.
thinking
**Updating the plan**

I can mark step 1 as completed and move on to step 2, but I need to follow the update_plan instruction carefully. It says that I shouldn't jump from pending to completed without proper progression. Since step 1 is in progress, that's good! Now, I'll proceed to mark step 1 as completed while also indicating that step 2 is now in progress. Time to execute the update_plan!
Plan update
Found the copyright string as `© 2026 简洁页面` in `index.html` on the local `main` branch; the current card branch doesn’t yet include `index.html`, so it will be added to this branch before editing.

thinking
**Deciding on Git Commands**

I’m considering whether we need to stage our changes or if we can simply use `git show` to redirect to a file. The easiest way seems to be running `git show main:index.html > index.html`, which creates the file without staging it. I want to make sure we don’t run into any trailing newline issues while copying. So, yep, let’s go ahead and copy index.html from the main branch into our worktree.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'cd /var/www/prdtest/.worktrees/test/IMP-0001 && git show main:index.html > index.html' in /var/www/prdtest/.worktrees/test/IMP-0001 succeeded in 51ms:

**Updating HTML Code**

I see that I need to modify the line in index.html that contains `© 2026 简洁页面` and change it to `© 2025～2026 简洁页面`. It's a good idea to confirm that the line exists before applying the patch to avoid any issues. I’m thinking I can use rg to search for that specific line. Once that's confirmed, I can proceed with applying the patch to update the file.

thinking
**Evaluating Git status**

I see that `git status` shows both `index.html` and `.prd-autopilot` as untracked files. Since we created `index.html` from `git show`, it's not staged yet. Even though it’s not committed, I think it’s wise to eventually add it for tracking, especially to facilitate a future commit. However, since the autopilot expects implemented changes, it’s fine that we’ve got untracked files. While staging could be beneficial, it’s also okay to leave `index.html` untracked if needed.
thinking
**Considering index.html tracking**

It seems that since `index.html` is untracked, our branch currently doesn’t include it. This means adding the file, rather than just editing an existing one. However, the card is expecting an update. I think we should incorporate `index.html` from the main branch and track it, which may require staging or committing it. To track it, I must add it to the git index, but without a commit, it stays uncommitted in the working tree. If I create a new `index.html`, that could still meet the requirement for the card.
thinking
**Evaluating index.html changes**

Maybe I shouldn’t just add `index.html`, but rather locate the existing file in the branch that contains the version for 2026 and make modifications there. Updating the correct file could involve first syncing my branch with the main commit 5226f24, but that might bring in `index.html`. Perhaps I can merge from the main without committing right away, or checkout `index.html` from that commit and stage it, leaving it uncommitted. Staging `index.html` might be sufficient since some systems recognize it as changed, and I can list it in the final output as `["index.html"]`. I need to remember to follow the instruction to work only inside the repo's worktree.
thinking
**Deciding on index.html staging**

It’s clear they don’t insist on a commit, so I have flexibility with staging. Using `git checkout main -- index.html` would update the file in both the index and working tree, but it would show as added in the status. Since `git checkout` effectively makes changes in both places, I think it might be cleaner to simply stage `index.html` for clarity. I wonder if using `git restore --source=main --staged --worktree index.html` would serve the same purpose? Ultimately, staging isn’t strictly necessary, but it might make things clearer.
thinking
**Managing index.html status**

I think we should avoid leaving `index.html` untracked, as this means it was added manually but not tracked by git. If someone checks out the branch, they won’t have the file unless it’s committed. While the worker's goal is to implement changes, having an untracked file might be seen as "implemented" but not "applied" to the branch. In the PRD autopilot runs, modifications are typically expected in the git worktree. We’ve also executed validation commands, and now we need to update the plan—marking step 3 as completed and step 4 as in progress. Time to update the plan!

**Evaluating file changes**

I need to consider the untracked `.prd-autopilot` artifact in the repo. It’s normal, but I wonder if it should be included in our `files_changed`, even though it wasn’t modified. `git status` shows it’s untracked, so it seems irrelevant. The prompt mentions `.prd-autopilot`, but since it isn't new or changed, I’ll focus on `index.html`, which is new, and possibly `test.txt`, though I think only `index.html` is relevant for `files_changed`. Should I also think about the commit message?
thinking
**Deciding on commit message**

The specification doesn’t mention a minimum length, so I could use an empty string for the commit message. But I think it's better to provide a helpful suggested message like "IMP-0001: Update copyright year range to 2025～2026" even if the commit isn't truly created. Autopilot may expect non-empty messages, and while the schema allows for empty strings, I’ll play it safe. I’ll also note that `index.html` was pulled from the local main branch, which isn't in origin. Keeping notes concise is important.
thinking
**Considering file addition implications**

It seems there could be an expectation to edit an existing file in the branch, but we actually need to add `index.html`. It feels a bit unnatural since the file exists in the local main but not in the branch. I’ll check to ensure that `index.html` is indeed new and includes the correct copyright year. While I could run `head`, I might just skip that. The card’s acceptance criteria are blank, so we can deliver despite some risk—other copyright statements might exist in the UI code elsewhere. Adding a README could be helpful, but it’s not necessary.
thinking
**Finalizing updates on index.html**

I think the right approach might be to update the copyright statement in `index.html` on the main branch rather than just the card branch. Since we’re in the card branch for the final review, I need to confirm that `index.html` includes the years 2025–2026 without independently listing 2026 in the footer. It seems we created `index.html` in the worktree correctly. `git status` shows just the untracked `.prd-autopilot` and `index.html`, which is good. I wonder if I should add `index.html` to `related_files`, but that’s not required, so I’ll finalize the plan and mark step 4 as completed.
